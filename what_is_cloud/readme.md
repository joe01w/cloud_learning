## What is Cloud?

### What is cloud computing? (in layman's terms)

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the cloud. It is the idea of renting a computer instead of buying one. 
Instead of having a physical computer at home or work, you use a computer that's in the cloud, which means it's somewhere else on the internet. 
You can access all your files, run programs, and do everything you'd normally do on a computer, but it's all happening on a remote server instead of on a computer sitting in front of you.

### How do we know if something is in the cloud? Differences between on-prem and the cloud?

**Data hosted on the cloud:**
* If data is stored on the cloud, it is usually hosted and managed by third-party cloud service providers in remote data centers.
* Cloud services often offer scalability, allowing users to easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
* Cloud services are owned and managed by cloud providers, relieving organizations of many operational responsibilities.

**Data hosted on-prem (on-premises):**
* Data typically is within an organization's physical premises, usually within their own data centers.
* On-premises solutions may require significant upfront investment in hardware to accommodate potential growth.
* With on-premises solutions, organizations own and are responsible for managing all aspects of the infrastructure, including hardware, software, security, and maintenance.

### The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud
Public cloud is cloud computing thatâ€™s delivered via the internet and shared across organizations.
<br>Private cloud is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization.
<br>Hybrid cloud is any environment that uses both public and private clouds.
<br>Multi-cloud strategies incorporate combinations of private and public clouds, often from different CSPs, for flexibility in meeting operational requirements.

### Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**
* Accessing computer hardware and infrastructure over the cloud, including servers, networks, operating systems, and storage, through virtualization technology.
* Highly scalable services

**PaaS (Platform as a Service):**
* Accessing cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. 
* PaaS delivers a framework that developers can build upon and use to create customized applications. 
* All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.

**SaaS (Software as a Service):**
* Accessing services over the cloud to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users. 
* A majority of SaaS applications run directly through your web browser

### What are the advantages/disadvantages of the cloud?
**Advantages:**

* **Scalability:** Cloud computing provides businesses with the flexibility to scale resources according to demand, enabling cost-effective adjustments to accommodate fluctuating workloads or rapid growth.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Operating on a pay-as-you-go model, cloud services offer potential cost savings compared to traditional on-premises solutions, as businesses only pay for the resources they use.
* **Accessibility:** Cloud services facilitate remote work and collaboration by allowing access from anywhere with an internet connection, enhancing productivity and flexibility for employees.
* **Reliability and Availability:** Cloud providers typically offer highly reliable infrastructure with redundancy and high availability, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous access to services critical for business operations.
* **Security:** Cloud providers invest in robust security measures, including encryption and compliance certifications, to protect data and infrastructure, enhancing overall security posture and mitigating cyber threats.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Dependency on Internet Connectivity:** Cloud services rely on internet connectivity, making businesses vulnerable to disruptions from network outages or slow internet speeds, potentially impacting productivity and access to essential applications and data.
* **Data Privacy Concerns:** Entrusting sensitive data to third-party cloud providers raises privacy and compliance concerns, necessitating careful consideration of data governance and compliance with regulations.
* **Potential for Vendor Lock-in:** Adoption of specific cloud services may lead to vendor lock-in, hindering the ability to migrate to alternative solutions. Businesses should assess and mitigate vendor lock-in risks, such as by leveraging multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.
* **Performance Issues:** While cloud providers aim to deliver optimal performance, businesses may encounter latency or performance issues, particularly with high-demand workloads or low-latency data access requirements.
* **Loss of Control:** Outsourcing IT infrastructure and services to cloud providers entails relinquishing some control over hardware, software, and security. Businesses must weigh the trade-offs between control and convenience when transitioning to the cloud.

### Difference between OpEx vs CapEx

OpEx *(Operational Expenditure)* covers ongoing expenses essential for daily operations, like rent, utilities, salaries, maintenance, and subscription services.
Cloud computing typically aligns with OpEx due to its subscription-based model.
<br>
<br>
CapEx *(Capital Expenditure)* represents investments in long-term assets like property, equipment, or infrastructure, with benefits spread over multiple years.
This would count as company's owning their own data centers, within an organization's physical premises.
