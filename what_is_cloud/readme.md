## What is Cloud?

### What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the cloud. It is the idea of renting a computer instead of buying one. 
Instead of having a physical computer at home or work, you use a computer that's in the cloud, which means it's somewhere else on the internet. 
You can access all your files, run programs, and do everything you'd normally do on a computer, but it's all happening on a remote server instead of on a computer sitting in front of you.

### How do we know if something is in the cloud? Differences between on-prem and the cloud?

**Data hosted on the cloud:**
* If data is stored on the cloud, it is usually hosted and managed by third-party cloud service providers in remote data centers.
* Cloud services often offer scalability, allowing users to easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
* Cloud services are owned and managed by cloud providers, relieving organizations of many operational responsibilities.

**Data hosted on-prem (on-premises):**
* Data typically is within an organization's physical premises, usually within their own data centers.
* On-premises solutions may require significant upfront investment in hardware to accommodate potential growth.
* With on-premises solutions, organizations own and are responsible for managing all aspects of the infrastructure, including hardware, software, security, and maintenance.

### The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud
Public cloud is cloud computing thatâ€™s delivered via the internet and shared across organizations.
<br>Private cloud is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization.
<br>Hybrid cloud is any environment that uses both public and private clouds.
<br>Multi-cloud strategies incorporate combinations of private and public clouds, often from different CSPs, for flexibility in meeting operational requirements.
