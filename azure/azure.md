# Microsoft Azure

## The Basics of Azure 
Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that offers a diverse range of services, including computing, storage, networking, databases, analytics, and artificial intelligence. It enables businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications and services globally through Microsoft's extensive network of data centers.

### Azure regions and availability zones: 
* Azure regions are geographic locations where Microsoft operates data centers, each comprising one or more data centers.

* Availability zones are physically separate data centers within a region, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. Deploying resources across availability zones ensures high availability and resiliency.

### How Azure is structured/organised 
Azure organizes its services into categories such as Compute, Storage, Networking, Databases, AI and Machine Learning, and Developer Tools. These services are further grouped into resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups to facilitate effective resource management.

### Types of services offered by Azure
**Azure provides a broad array of services:** 
* Computing (virtual machines, containers) 
* Storage (blobs, files, tables) 
* Networking (virtual networks, load balancers) 
* Databases (SQL Database, Cosmos DB) 
* AI and Machine Learning (Cognitive Services, Machine Learning) 
* Developer tools (Azure DevOps, Visual Studio)

### Accessing Azure
Users can access Azure through various means, including the Azure Portal (web-based interface), Azure CLI (command-line interface), Azure PowerShell (PowerShell cmdlets), Azure APIs (REST APIs), and the Azure Mobile App (mobile application).

### Difference between Azure and Azure DevOps
Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure and services for building, deploying, and managing applications and services. Azure DevOps, on the other hand, is a suite of development tools and services for collaboration, software development, and DevOps practices. It includes services like Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, Azure Boards, Azure Test Plans, and Azure Artifacts.

### Benefits of using the Azure Pricing Calculator
The Azure Pricing Calculator helps estimate the cost of using Azure services based on specific requirements. By selecting desired services and configuring resources, users can obtain a monthly cost estimate. This assists in budgeting, planning, and optimizing costs by selecting suitable services and configurations.
